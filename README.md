### Haley Benson

I’m a graduate of Texas State, I majored in Computer Science and minored in Applied Math. Graduated in 3.5 years with Magna Cum Laude honors. From there I went on to be a beta program student for a company where they were impressed with my skills and work ethic so they gave me the opportunity that I now have as a contract developer for them. I work with my team and on my own to bring our clients' visions to life. I love being a problem solver, no matter the complexity and I enjoy building user friendly, efficient websites. I’ve done website maintenance, ran new client meetings and I enjoy writing clean, buildable code. Most of my experience is with front-end applications, but I also continue my education outside of work, honing my skills in SQL, diving deeper into JavaScript frameworks and working on various coding practices.
